# ESP32-Dev-Mod-CESAR

Secure Development of DER Enabled Devices


Project Goals:
● Develop a Secure ESP32 OpenADR Client for DER
  ○ Configure the ESP32 to securely communicate with the OpenADR VTN.
  ○ Incorporate best practices for cryptographic authentication and encryption,
    particularly relevant to DER devices.
● Implement and Test an OpenADR VTN with DER Security Emphasis
  ○ Deploy the OpenADR VTN server from the GitHub repository.
  ○ Emphasize configurations for secure management of DER endpoints, ensuring
    resilience against threats like spoofing or replay attacks.
● Assess and Document DER Security Approaches
  ○ Identify potential vulnerabilities when integrating DERs with demand response
    systems.
  ○ Produce a comprehensive report on mitigation strategies, emphasizing security
    lifecycle management (e.g., certificate rotation, firmware updates).
